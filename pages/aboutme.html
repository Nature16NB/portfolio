<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nisarg Bhatt and I am a high school student. This website was built by me as a project 
        for my Computer Science course in my school. Besides this website, I dont have any other projects at the moment
        but I do look forward to it. Some of my hobbies are reading, gaming and watching videos about the 
        struggles and stories of the public & popular celebrities. Some of the shows I like to watch are The Good 
        Doctor, The Flash, Arrow, and The Big Bang Theory. Some of the sports I like to play are soccer, ball hockey,
        badminton, and football (not so great at it). 
        </p>
