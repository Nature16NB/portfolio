<h2>Tech Experiences</h2>
    <p>
        I have had experience with coding before by going through tutorials on Khan Academy and Code
        Academy. I am currently learning coding through a high school course on Computer Science 
        and I would like to learn coding using Python, JavaScript, HTML and C++ because I want to keep up with 
        the changes of the world technologically.
