    <p>Hello, welcome to my website that I built from scratch. This website is just to give a brief introduction to who I am, what 
        experiences I have and what projects I have done. This website itself is a project and is given to students to learn and 
        understand how to build an effective website for the future. There are usually many problems that come in people's way when trying 
        to make a website from scratch, but, with patience and the right teachings, anyone can learn how to build a website from tutorials 
        from other websites like Code Academy or w3schools. Hope you like this website very well and have a nice day! I will leave you to it :) 
    </p>
